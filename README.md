## Description
This project predicts car prices using Machine Learning based on features such as brand, manufacturing year, mileage, fuel type, and transmission.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
- PyCharm

## Project Workflow
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Feature Engineering  
4. Model Training using Regression  
5. Model Evaluation  

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository  
2. Install required libraries  
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python file  

## Result
The trained model predicts car prices and evaluates performance using regression metrics.
